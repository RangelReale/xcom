<h1>XCOM Tutorial</h1>

<p>In this tutorial we develop a simple XCOM component and a test program
that access the component. We assume that the installation
steps are completed, XCOM header files are placed into 
directory <code>~/include</code>,the <code>libxcom.so</code>
is placed into directory <code>~/lib</code> and the
XCOM's idl files are placed in directory <code>~/idl</code>.</p>

<h2>XCOM IDL - XCOM Interface Definition Language</h2>

<p>XCOM contains many similarities with other component systems especially
Microsoft's COM and Mozilla XPCOM. All these systems are interface based
binary component standards where there is a root interface that
provides capability querying and lifetime management services through
reference counting.</p>

<p>At the very heart of the component based programming lies interfaces. A
component encapsulates implementation that can be accessed using the
provided interfaces by the component. In simple terms an interface
is a named list of functions. In XCOM you specify the interfaces
and the datatypes in a special declarative language which resembles
most of the other IDL's.</p>

<p>In the following code snipped a simple interface named
<code>simple.IHello</code> is defined:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
import &quot;xcom/IUnknown.idl&quot;;

namespace simple
{
    interface IHello (&quot;91c16a9e-b609-47cf-885a-644218dd4067&quot;) extends xcom::IUnknown
    {
        void sayTo(in string who);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>There are a few things noteworthy to explain. The first line
is an <em>import</em> statement which is used to bring definitions from
other IDL files. You must directly or indirectly import
<code>xcom/IUnknown.idl</code> file in your IDL files.</p>

<p>The second point is the <em>namespace</em> line. Namespaces are used
to partition the namespace of datatypes to prevent name collisions. Namespaces
can be nested arbitrarily deep.</p>

<p>Then the interface definition comes. Following the <em>interface</em>
keyword the textual name of the interface comes, here it is <code>IHello</code>
then the numeric name follows. This numeric name is an 128-bit identifier
that is globally unique, which is called a <em>GUID</em>. This number can be
generated using the <code>uuidgen</code> utility. After that, the
<em>extends</em> part comes. Every interface must inherit from another
interface except the root interface <code>xcom.IUnknown</code>. This
means that, at the end, every interface inherit from <code>xcom.IUnknown</code>
directly or indirectly. More comes for this interface. Then the list
of functions comes, specifying return type, name and the parameters. The
parameters must specify an access mode, parameter type and a name. The access
mode can be one of <code>in</code>, <code>out</code> or <code>inout</code>.</p>

<h2>Generating Headers</h2>

<p>Save the code listing given above to a file named <code>Simple.idl</code>.
Now comes generation of the header files that will be used by the component
implementation and the client.</p>

<p>The <code>xcomidl</code> utility is used to generate C++ headers from
IDL files. Its usage is given below:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
$ xcomidl -I include_path1 -I include_path2 ... idlFile1.idl idlFile2.idl ...
</pre>

<p>Now if you run <code>xcomidl</code> on the <code>Simple.idl</code>:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
$ xcomidl -I ~/idl Simple.idl
</pre>

<p>This generates two files <code>Simple.hpp</code> and
<code>SimpleTie.hpp</code> respectively. The first file is common to
both component implementors and component users. The second file is used
only by the component implementor.</p>

<h2>Component Implementation</h2>

<p>The following listing gives a complete implementation for our
component:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
#include &lt;xcom/ImplHelper.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;xcom/ExcImpl.inc&gt;

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &quot;SimpleTie.hpp&quot;

namespace
{
    struct HelloImpl
        : public xcom::Supports&lt;HelloImpl, simple::IHello&gt;,
          public xcom::RefCounted&lt;HelloImpl&gt;
    {
        void sayTo(xcom::Char const* name)
        {
            std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; '\n';
        }
    };    

    struct DLLAccess : public xcom::DLLAccessBase
    {
        DLLAccess()
        {
            classes.push_back(&quot;MyHelloImpl&quot;);
            
            xcom::TypeDesc&lt;simple::IHello&gt;::addSelf(types);
            
            addInterface(&quot;IHello&quot;);
        }
        
        xcom::IUnknown dllCreateObject(xcom::Char const* cname)
        {
            if(strcmp(cname, &quot;MyHelloImpl&quot;) == 0)
            {
                return new HelloImpl;
            }
            
            return 0;
        }
    };
}

XCOM_PROVIDE_DLL_ACCESS(DLLAccess)
</pre>

<p>The <code>ImplHelper.hpp</code> header provides support classes for
implementing the <code>addRef</code>, <code>release</code> and
<code>queryInterface</code> methods.</p>

<p>Here the real component implementation is the <code>HelloImpl</code> class.
The <code>Supports</code> base class implements the inherited
<code>queryInterface</code> method and the <code>RefCounted</code> class
provides implementations for the <code>addRef</code> and <code>release</code>
methods. To implement an interface in a component all methods given in 
the interface must be implemented. As the only method in the <code>IHello</code>
interface is <code>sayTo</code>, only it's implementation is given.</p>

<p>The remaining <code>DLLAccess</code> class and the macro invocation
at the end provides the implementations of required functions that
all XCOM component shared libraries must export. For the implementor,
he must add the names of classes he wants to create to a list. Any
number of classes can be specified as long as the
<code>dllCreateObject</code> function creates instances when any of
the registered names are given. The second line in the constructor
adds metadata descriptions of the used interfaces in the component
to an internal list. The third line registers the name of the given
interface to an internal list. The last two functions are used to
provide metadata outside world.</p>

<p>You can compile the component to a shared library using the following
commands:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
$ gcc -shared -Wl,-Bsymbolic -Wall -O0 -g -o comp.so -I ~/include Component.cpp -L ~/lib -lxcom
</pre>

<p>You may have to adjust the -I and -L switches in case the location
of XCOM headers and libraries are different.</p>

<h2>Using Components</h2>

<p>In this part we'll develop a program that uses our simple component. Before
that a little explanation about how XCOM locates components given their
name. At program startup XCOM searches for a whose name is <code>.config</code>
suffix appended to executable's name. This file must contain a directory
name per line. XCOM adds these directories to an internal search list.
When a request is made to load a component given its name, XCOM searches
these directories for a file with the same name as component and a
suffix depending on the platform. Given the file is found, it is loaded and
a handle to it returned in the form of <code>xcom.ILibrary</code> interface.
</p>

<p>Here is the sample application that uses our component:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
#include &quot;Simple.hpp&quot;
#include &lt;xcom/Loader.hpp&gt;

int main()
{
    xcom::loadAsBuiltin(&quot;comp&quot;);
    
    simple::IHello hello(xcom::createObjectAs&lt;simple::IHello&gt;(&quot;MyHelloImpl&quot;));
    hello.sayTo(&quot;ali&quot;);
    hello.sayTo(&quot;veli&quot;);
}
</pre>

<p>The first include header, is the generated one which contains
the class generated for <code>simple.IHello</code> interface.
The second header is a standard XCOM header which provides component loading
functions.</p>

<p>The first line in main loads the component named <em>comp</em> and
make the classes in it available for instantiating. The
<code>createObjectAs</code> template function takes an interface
as template parameter and a string as first argument, which tries
to instantiate given the class name by searching the loaded libraries.
If it founds a match, creates an instance and casts to the given
interface using <code>IUnknown.queryInterface</code> method behind the
scenes. After we have an interface to a component at hand we can easily
call the functions through.</p>

<p>You can compile the client program using the following command:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
$ gcc -o client -I ~/xcom/include Main.cpp -L ~/lib -lxcom
</pre>

<p>When you run the program directly you should get an <em>Aborted</em>
message even you have compiled the component before as XCOM does not
know where it can find the library. You can show where is the component
by creating a file named <code>client.config</code> in the same
directory as the <code>client</code> executable and putting the directory
in which our component resides. After that step you can run the program
and see the following messages:</p>

<pre class="csnip">
hello ali
hello veli
</pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This tutorial just scratched surface of XCOM by creating a very simple
component and a client. The idl compiler of the XCOM can be examined
for a more complex program as it is also component based.</p>
