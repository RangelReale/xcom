<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>XCOM is a system designed to support component based programming in Linux.
Although the system primarily targets Linux other POSIX supporting operating
systems and Win32 class operating systems are planned to be supported.</p>

<p>The following design goals are followed in making the current system:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Binary interface standard</li>
 <li>Simplicity and ease of use</li>
 <li>Good C++ support</li>
 <li>Portability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The current version of XCOM have the following features:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Specialized IDL compiler generating C++ code.</li>
 <li>In-process components.</li>
 <li>Embedded metadata.</li>
 <li>Most of the common numeric data types.</li>
 <li>Narrow and wide string types.</li>
 <li><code>array</code>, <code>sequence</code>, and <code>struct</code>
 types.</li>
 <li>Error reporting via exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The IDL compiler generates C++ code which conforms to the binary standard
of XCOM. When the generated code is compiled its binary layout conforms
to the XCOMs binary format. Most notably, other component systems
uses virtual functions to implement this kind of functionality, but
in XCOM a mix of templates and inheritance is used to provide a
similar mechanism without using virtual functions because the mechanisms
used for implementing virtual function mechanism may change
from compiler to compiler. Also the binary format rules of the
XCOM is designed to be not overly C++ oriented and not prohibit
implementing remoting in the future.</p>

<p>The generated C++ code permits the use of the system without delving
to the binary details, such as reference counting and memory management.
In most of the scenarios all of these can be handled behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Error reporting via exceptions are also supported natively
provided only the IDL defined exception objects are allowed to propagate
through interface methods. Inheritance between exception types are
also supported in order to support complex usage scenarios.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>The following are possible enhancements that may be implemented in
future versions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Support for different programming languages.</li>
 <li>Remoting support.</li>
 <li>Interception support.</li>
 <li>Web services.</li>
</ul>

written component implementation helper templates and macros, and nearly all
of the present documentation.</p>
